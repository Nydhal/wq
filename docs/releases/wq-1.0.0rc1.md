# wq 1.0.0 RC1

**wq 1.0.0 RC1** is the first release candidate of the upcoming [1.0 version](https://github.com/wq/wq/issues/22) of [wq](../index.md).  The RC brings a number of new features and refinements since the [second beta release](./wq-1.0.0b2.md).

See the submodule release notes for details:
- [wq.app 1.0.0rc1](./wq.app-1.0.0rc1.md)
- [wq.db 1.0.0rc1](./wq.db-1.0.0rc1.md)
- [wq.start 1.0.0rc1](./wq.start-1.0.0rc1.md)

`wq.core` and `wq.io` remain unchanged since the first beta release.

With this RC, the API for wq 1.0 is essentially fixed.  Unless any major bugs are found, wq 1.0 will be essentially the same as this RC, perhaps with a few minor enhancements and bugfixes.
