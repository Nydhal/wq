# wq.core 1.3 alpha

**wq.core 1.3 alpha** is a preview of the next version of wq.core, as part of the [wq 1.3 alpha](./wq-1.3.0a1.md) release.  There are minimal changes to wq.core, other than the deprecation of the `wq versions` command, which will be removed entirely in wq.core 2.0.  (Use `pip freeze` instead.)
