# natural-keys 1.1.0

natural-keys 1.1.0 includes an update for compatibility with Django REST Framework 3.5, specifically the [requirement](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/3.5-announcement/#modelserializer-fields-and-exclude) that all ModelSerializers have an explicit `fields` or `exclude` attribute.
